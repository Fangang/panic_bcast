panic-bcast is a network protocol panic button operating decentralized through UDP broadcasts and HTTP. It's intended to act a panic button in a sensitive network. A serious freedom fighter will run something like this on all nodes in the computerized network.

Here's how it works:

1. An opsec activist has uninvited guests at the door
2. The activist sends the panic signal, a UDP broadcast, with panic-bcast
3. Other machines in the network pick up the panic signal and repeat it
4. Once panic-bcast has picked up and repeated the panic signal it ejects critical drives to secure any encrypted containers. It then overwrites the memory to make cold boot attacks harder.

Remember kids: there's no home for swap in opsec.
